  abstract = {A pyrolysis chamber is described for the direct determination of mercury in sediments by atomic absorption spectrometry. The finely ground and dried sample is weighed (2.0-60.0 mg), transferred to a quartz cup, inserted in a pyrolysis chamber and heated at 1100 °C for 30 s by means of three focused infrared lamps in the presence of an air stream as the carrier gas. Interfering substances are destroyed by a precolumn containing alumina, silica and copper(n) oxide, and the released mercury is amalgamated on to a gold-coated collector. Mercury vapour is later measured by AAS after thermal desorption. Calibration is easily performed by flow injection, in which known volumes of mercury-saturated air are introduced into the same air carrier stream. The absolute detection limit was 0.26 ng Hg and the relative standard deviation of measurements (n = 12) from a typical 4.0 mg sample was about 7{\%}. By applying a t-test, there was no significant difference at the 5{\%} probability level between the results obtained with the proposed method and those certified or recommended for NIST materials. One analysis takes only 2 min, including sample weighing.},

In DBL, Hg profiles in sediments clearly documented the evolution of Hg pollution, and Hg was significantly higher in fish and human hair than in PL. 203Hg methylation rates in sediments and methylmercury proportions in fish suggest a high Hg bioavailability in both lakes. Average daily fish intake is approx. 200 g, and at DBL 95{\%} of fish samples (N = 40) exceeded the 150 ng Hg g-1 safety limit. Hg in human hair averaged 28 $\mu$g g-1 (N = 15), i.e. a level at which neurotoxic effects have been found. However, Hg was also high in the pristine PL, where 67-100{\%} (N = 34) of the fish had levels that exceeded the safety limit, and 87{\%} of hair samples (N = 15) had above 10 ng Hg g-1.

  abstract = {Mercury (Hg total) fluxes were calculated for rainwater, throughfall and stream water in a small catchment located in the northeastern region of the Brazilian Amazon (Serra do Navio, Amapa State), whose upper part is covered by a natural rainforest and lower part was altered due to deforestation and activities related to manganese mining. The catchment area is 200 km from the nearest gold mining (garimpo). Minimum and maximum Hg concentrations were measured monthly from October 1996 to September 1997 and were 3.5-23.4 ng l-1 for rainwater, 16.5-82.7 ng l-1 for throughfall (March-August 1997) and 1.2-6.1 and 4.2-18.8 ng l-1 for stream water, in natural and disturbed areas, respectively. In the natural area, the inputs were 18.2 $\mu$g m-2 year-1 in rainwater and 72 $\mu$g m-2 year-1 in throughfall. This enrichment was attributed to dry deposition. The stream output of 2.9 $\mu$g m-2 year-1 indicates that Hg is being recycled within the forest as other chemical species or is being retained by the soil system, as confirmed by the cumulative Hg burden in the 0-10 cm surface layer, which was 36480 $\mu$g m-2. When the disturbed area of the catchment was included, the stream output was 9.3 $\mu$g m-2, clearly indicating the impact of the deforestation of the lower part of the basin on the release of mercury. The Hg burden in the disturbed area was 7560 $\mu$g m-2 for the 0-10 cm surface layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

These values were compared with those from the Igarape Pedra Preta basin, an area unaffected by mining activities. Total mercury contents were determined in the muddy (silt+clay) fraction of the sediments and in the {\textless}2 mm fraction of the soils using radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA). The detection limit of the method was 54 $\mu$g {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 for soils and 14 $\mu$g {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 for sediments when 200 mg of sample were analysed. The Hg results obtained from a comparison between our current method (RNAA) and CV AAS are also presented. Mercury levels showed to be very high in the soils and sediments collected in the Vila Nova river (up to 2 mg {\textperiodcentered} kg-1) when compared to background values (0.3 mg {\textperiodcentered} kg-1) for this region. An enrichment factor was calculated, using Al as a normalizing factor. It showed values up to 8 in sediments of the Vila Nova river basin, indicating a relatively high degree of pollution as compared to the values of about I for the samples of the Igarape Pedra Preta basin.},

  abstract = {This work focuses on the behaviour of mercury in lateritic soil profiles found in the Serra do Navio and Tartarugalzinho areas of the State of Amap{\'{a}} in Northern Brazil. The Hg contents are high in the upper horizons of the soil profiles (100-300 $\mu$g kg-1), and decrease to less than 100 $\mu$g kg-1 at depths of 200 or 300 cm. The higher levels of Hg are associated with higher Fe concentrations, particularly in the ferruginous accumulations as mottles and nodules. For each horizon of the soil profile, balance calculations were used to distinguish the amount of mercury naturally accumulated from rocks through lateritic pedogenesis (lithogenic mercury) from the anthropogenic mercury introduced in the profile through atmospheric contamination. The results show that the anthropogenic contribution is significant in the upper horizons (up to 95{\%} of the total Hg), and decreases downward in the soil profile. Mercury burdens were calculated for soil profiles in both upslope (272 880 and 217 440 $\mu$g m-2 for the first 70 cm) and downslope positions (118 800 and 182 160 $\mu$g m-2 for the first 70 cm). The loss of Hg in downslope profiles seems to be related to the natural evolution of iron duricrust into latossols, which has been brought about by climatic changes toward increasing humidity in the Amazon since the Tertiary.},

In sediment, the average Hg concentrations varied between 33 ± 17 ng g-1 and 106 ± 78 ng g-1, in samples collected during the rainy and dry season, respectively. The same averages were also found for soil samples (35 ± 14 and 109 ± 61 ng g -1). In water, the total Hg concentration varied between {\textless} 1.1 and 24.0 ng L-1. In piscivore fish, up to 943 $\mu$ g Hg kg-1 was found. Our results show that all compartments undergo Hg contamination, in view of the levels found in pristine environments. Water contamination seems to be due mainly to diffuse processes of soil erosion and suspension of river bed sediment during the rainy season. Also untreated wastewaters generated by industrial activities and from domestic sewage appear to be potential non-point sources in the most industrialized and populated part of the basin. On the other hand, atmospheric transport of mercury originating from the Campinas Metropolitan Region could be another source of mercury contamination, especially in the basin headwaters. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

No significant difference was observed between the concentrations found at the two sampling areas and the mean values were 7.0 ± 5.8 ng m -3 (TGM) and 0.4 ± 0.3 ng m-3 (TPM). The analysis of the diel variability showed higher TGM concentrations during the day, which could be related to more intense anthropogenic activity during the day. Atmospheric dispersion processes could also explain some seasonal variation observed in TGM concentrations. For TPM concentrations a decreasing trend was observed during the rainy season, which could be explained by the removal of particles by wet deposition. The concentrations of TGM and TPM found in this study were of the same order of magnitude of those recorded in some highly industrialized regions of the northern hemisphere. These data show that emissions from the most industrialized Brazilian regions, and probably from similar regions in other countries of the southern hemisphere, should also be assessed and integrated into the global anthropogenic mercury emission assessment. {\textcopyright}2006 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu{\'{i}}mica.},

The effect of many parameters was sequentially studied: TiO2 concentration of the coating solution, Fe(II) concentration, pH, solar irradiation time; dissolved organic carbon concentration. The final conditions (TiO2 concentration of the coating solution: 10{\%}; Fe(II): 7.0 mg l-1; solar exposure time: 120 min) were applied to natural water samples spiked with 500 $\mu$g l-1 As(III) in order to verify the influence of natural water matrix. After treatment, As(III) and total As concentrations were lower than the limit of quantitation (2 $\mu$g l-1) of the voltammetric method used, showing a removal over 99{\%}, and giving evidence that As(III) was effectively oxidized to As(V). The results obtained demonstrated that TiO2 can be easily immobilized on a PET surface in order to perform As(III) oxidation in water and that this TiO2 immobilization, combined with coprecipitation of arsenic on Fe(III) hydroxides(oxides) could be an efficient way for inorganic arsenic removal from groundwaters. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The type of soil, which is the main source of mercury for the water bodies, the hydrological cycle with floods and dry periods, act markedly on the water redox chemistry. A complex interaction between many seasonable variables such as solar intensity, water pH, age of the naturally occurring organic matter and the hydrological cycle alter the redox characteristics of these black water bodies, thus markedly affecting the consumption of Hg0 and the degradation of methylmercury present in the water. Although methylation is favored in black waters, photodegradation counterpoints this formation, thus regulating the methylmercury burden in the water column. {\textcopyright}2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu{\'{i}}mica.},

Although the Amazon forest accounts for approximately 25{\%} of the world's total rainforest, few data are available about these emissions. The emissions of mercury from prescribed fires of two 4-ha plots of Amazon forest were investigated. Hg concentration and Hg burden were determined for vegetation, litter and soil before and after the fires. The data show that only Hg present in the aboveground vegetation and in the O-horizon was volatilised; no significant soil emission was observed. Before the fire, the Hg stored in the vegetation (logs, branches, leaves and litter) ranged from 3.7 to 4.0 g ha-1 while 1.8 g ha-1 was found in the O-horizon. The mass balance calculations of the present work indicate an average Hg emission of 3.5 g ha-1 due to forest fires, with 1.6 ha-1 originating from O-horizon and 1.9 from above ground vegetation. On the base of the average annual deforestation rate of the Brazilian Amazon between 2000 and 2008, an annual Hg emission of 6.7 Mg yr-1 was estimated.},

Fire liberates a portion of this mercury; however, little is known about the long-term release of mercury post deforestation. We conducted two large-scale experiments to study this phenomenon. In upstate New York, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored continually using a Teflon dynamic surface flux chamber for two-weeks before and after cutting of the canopy on the edge of a deciduous forest. In Brazil, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored in an intact Ombrophilous Open forest and an adjacent field site both before and after the field site was cleared by burning. In the intact forest, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged-0.73±1.84ngm-2h-1 (24-h monitoring) at the New York site, and 0.33±0.09ngm-2h-1 (daytime-only) at the Brazil site. After deforestation, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged 9.13±2.08ngm-2h-1 in New York and 21.2±0.35ngm-2h-1 at the Brazil site prior to burning. Gaseous mercury emissions averaged 74.9±0.73ngm-2h-1 after burning of the cut forest in Brazil. Extrapolating our data, measured over several weeks to months, to a full year period, deforested soil is estimated to release an additional 2.30gha-1yr-1 of gaseous mercury to the atmosphere in the Brazilian experiment and 0.41gha-1yr-1 in the New York experiment. In Brazil, this represents an additional 50{\%} of the mercury load released during the fire itself. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

The effect of cooking on Hg concentration in the samples was also studied. The results showed that Hg concentration was generally higher in the cooked samples than in raw samples. This increase can be related to the effect of Hg pre-concentration, formation of complexes involving mercury species and sulfhydryl groups present in tissues and/or loss of water and fat.

However, in forest fires, the carbon stored during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. The carbon quantification, in forest burning, is important for the development of measures for its control. The aim of this study was to quantify CO2 and CO emissions of forest fires in Western Amazonia. In this paper, results are described of forest fire experiments conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul and Rio Branco, state of Acre, and Candeias do Jamari, state of Rond{\^{o}}nia, Brazil. These cities are located in the Western portion of the Brazilian Amazon region. The biomass content per hectare, in the virgin forest, was measured by indirect methods using formulas with parameters of forest inventories in the central hectare of the test site. The combustion completeness was estimated by randomly selecting 10{\%} of the total logs and twelve 2 × 2 m2 areas along three transects and examining their consumption rates by the fire. The logs were used to determine the combustion completeness of the larger materials (characteristic diameters larger than 10 cm) and the 2 × 2 m2 areas to determine the combustion completeness of small-size materials (those with characteristic diameters lower than 10 cm) and the. The overall biomass consumption by fire was estimated to be 40.0{\%}, 41.2{\%} and 26.2{\%}, in Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Branco and Candeias do Jamari, respectively. Considering that the combustion gases of carbon in open fires contain approximately 90.0{\%} of CO2 and 10.0{\%} of CO in volumetric basis, the average emission rates of these gases by the burning process, in the three sites, were estimated as 191 ± 46.7 t ha-1 and 13.5 ± 3.3 t ha-1, respectively.},

Because a substantial proportion of sulfonamides are excreted unchanged as parent compounds after administration or are excreted as their metabolites through urine and feces, their presence in soils is a matter of concern. Adsorption and desorption are important processes that influence the transport, transformation and bioavailability of antimicrobials in soils, and data related to sorption capacity are therefore needed for environmental risk assessments. The sorption potential of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) was assessed in four Brazilians soils using batch equilibrium experiments. The adsorption/desorption data fit well Freundlich isotherms. The sorption coefficients (KD) ranged from 1.00 to 4.48 cm3 g-1, and the Freundlich adsorption coefficient (KF) ranged from 1.89 to 5.63 $\mu$g1-1/n (cm3)1/n g-1 showing that SCP adsorption is generally low in the studied soils. The results were compared with previously published data obtained for the sorption of other sulfonamides in the same four soils.},
