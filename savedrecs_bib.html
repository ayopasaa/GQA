  abstract = {{Forests represent an important role in the control of atmospheric
   emissions through carbon capture. However, in forest fires, the carbon
   stored during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. The carbon
   quantification, in forest burning, is important for the development of
   measures for its control. The aim of this study was to quantify CO2 and
   CO emissions of forest fires in Western Amazonia. In this paper, results
   are described of forest fire experiments conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul
   and Rio Branco, state of Acre, and Candeias do Jamari, state of
   Rondonia, Brazil. These cities are located in the Western portion of the
   Brazilian Amazon region. The biomass content per hectare, in the virgin
   forest, was measured by indirect methods using formulas with parameters
   of forest inventories in the central hectare of the test site. The
   combustion completeness was estimated by randomly selecting 10\% of the
   total logs and twelve 2 x 2 m(2) areas along three transects and
   examining their consumption rates by the fire. The logs were used to
   determine the combustion completeness of the larger materials
   (characteristic diameters larger than 10 cm) and the 2 x 2 m(2) areas to
   determine the combustion completeness of small-size materials (those
   with characteristic diameters lower than 10 cm) and the. The overall
   biomass consumption by fire was estimated to be 40.0\%, 41.2\% and
   26.2\%, in Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Branco and Candeias do Jamari,
   respectively. Considering that the combustion gases of carbon in open
   fires contain approximately 90.0\% of CO2 and 10.0\% of CO in volumetric
   basis, the average emission rates of these gases by the burning process,
   in the three sites, were estimated as 191 +/- 46.7 t ha(-1) and 13.5 +/-
   3.3 t ha(-1), respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Fire liberates a portion of this mercury; however, little is known about
   the long-term release of mercury post deforestation. We conducted two
   large-scale experiments to study this phenomenon. In upstate New York,
   gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored continually using a
   Teflon dynamic surface flux chamber for two-weeks before and after
   cutting of the canopy on the edge of a deciduous forest. In Brazil,
   gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored in an intact
   Ombrophilous Open forest and an adjacent field site both before and
   after the field site was cleared by burning. In the intact forest,
   gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged -0.73 +/- 1.84 ng m(-2)
   h(-1) (24-h monitoring) at the New York site, and 0.33 +/- 0.09 ng m(-2)

   after burning of the cut forest in Brazil. Extrapolating our data,
   measured over several weeks to months, to a full year period, deforested
   soil is estimated to release an additional 2.30 g ha(-1) yr(-1) of

   re-emit important quantities of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg)
   to the atmosphere. Although the Amazon forest accounts for approximately
   25\% of the world's total rainforest, few data are available about these
   emissions. The emissions of mercury from prescribed fires of two 4-ha
   plots of Amazon forest were investigated. Hg concentration and Hg burden
   were determined for vegetation, litter and soil before and after the
   fires. The data show that only Hg present in the aboveground vegetation
   and in the O-horizon was volatilised; no significant soil emission was
   observed. Before the fire, the Hg stored in the vegetation (logs,
   branches, leaves and litter) ranged from 3.7 to 4.0 g ha(-1) while 1.8 g
   ha(-1) was found in the O-horizon. The mass balance calculations of the
   present work indicate an average Hg emission of 3.5 g ha(-1) due to
   forest fires, with 1.6 ha(-1) originating from O-horizon and 1.9 from
   above ground vegetation. On the base of the average annual deforestation

   area is 200 km from the nearest gold mining (garimpo). Minimum and
   maximum Hg concentrations were measured monthly from October 1996 to
   September 1997 and were 3.5-23.4 ng l(-1) for rainwater, 16.5-82.7 ng
   l(-1) for throughfall (March-August 1997) and 1.2-6.1 and 4.2-18.8 ng
   l(-1) for stream water, in natural and disturbed areas, respectively. In
   the natural area, the inputs were 18.2 mu g m(-2) year(-1) in rainwater
   and 72 mu g m(-2) year(-1) in throughfall. This enrichment was
   attributed to dry deposition. The stream output of 2.9 mu g m(-2)
   year(-1) indicates that Hg is being recycled within the forest as other
   chemical species or is being retained by the soil system, as confirmed
   by the cumulative Hg burden in the 0-10 cm surface layer, which was 36
   480 mu g m When the disturbed area of the catchment was included, the
   stream output was 9.3 mu g m(-2), clearly indicating the impact of the
   deforestation of the lower part of the basin on the release of mercury.
   The Hg burden in the disturbed area was 7560 mu g m(-2) for the 0-10 cm
   surface layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   sediments and soils from a gold mining area along the Vila Nova river,
   in Amapa State, Brazil, are presented. These values were compared with
   those from the Igarape: Pedra Preta basin, an area unaffected by mining
   activities. Total mercury contents were determined in the muddy
   (silt+clay) fraction of the sediments and in the <2 mm fraction of the
   soils using radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA). The
   detection limit of the method was 54 mu g.kg(-1) for soils and 14 mu
   g.kg(-1) for sediments when 200 mg of sample were analysed. The Hg
   results obtained from a comparison between our current method (RNAA) and
   CV AAS are also presented. Mercury levels showed to be very high in the
   soils and sediments collected in the Vila Nova river (up to 2 mg.kg(-1))
   when compared to background values (0.3 mg.kg(-1)) for this region. An
   enrichment factor was calculated, using Al as a normalizing factor. It
   showed values up to 8 in sediments of the Vila Nova river basin,
   indicating a relatively high degree of pollution as compared to the
   values of about 1 for the samples of the Igarape Pedra Preta basin.}},

   suggest a high Hg bioavailability in both lakes. Average daily fish

   found. However, Hg was also high in the pristine FL, where 67-100\% (N =
