abstract = {Experiments in saturated soil columns were performed to investigate the transport and retention of 25 nm and 75 nm silver nanoparticles stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-AgNPs) in two Brazilian soils (sandy and sandy-clay). The normalized concentration of the PVP-AgNPs was obtained through a flow injection analysis method based on the surface plasmon ressonance effect of the metallic nanoparticles. The use of the ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) allows a rapid and low-cost analysis. The obtained breakthrough curves (BCs) were modeled with a deterministic model of solute transport in steady conditions of water flow and considering two regions of non-physical equilibrium; this model allowed the determination of the hydrodynamic parameters. It was found that the process occurs in condition of non-equilibrium, with a low mass transfer for larger NP, and that the process is predominantly advective and affected by the pore size of the soil packed in the columns. The BCs for PVP-AgNPs obtained by UV–Vis spectroscopy were compared with the BCs obtained by ICP-MS and with BCs of the bromide anion, confirming that the nanoparticles have a low retention and few modifications when transported through the soil column. These PVP-AgNPs are highly mobile and can be transported through the studied tropical soils, representing a potential environmental problem, due to the possibility of these materials reaching groundwater. On the contrary, the conservative behavior of PVP-AgNPs in the studied tropical soils, indicates its potential use as tracers, substituting the bromide anion which has been demonstrated to be not a good tracer in the same conditions.},

abstract = {Mercury emissions from artisanal gold mining operations occurring in roughly 80 developing countries are a major workplace health hazard for millions of people as well as the largest contributor to global mercury pollution. There are no portable, cheap, and rapid methods able to inform workers or health practitioners of mercury exposure on site in remote locations. In this work, a proof of concept for a miniaturized mercury sampler, prepared by the direct reduction of gold into the porous nanostructures of Vycor glass (PVG), is introduced. Mercury retention on the PVG/Au sampler induces significant color changes, due to the formation of Au-Hg amalgam that affects the surface plasmon resonance characteristics of the material. The color change can potentially be quantified by the analysis of pictures obtained with a cell phone camera rapidly and onsite. Laboratory experiments showed the viability of using PVG/Au as passive sampler for monitoring of Hg°. PVG/Au samplers were then deployed in an artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) operations in Burkina Faso and it was able to indicate personal mercury exposures. The amount of mercury quantified in the samplers for all miners was higher than the current personal exposure limit set by the US Occupational Safety {\&} Health Administration (OSHA).},

found in the Serra do Navio and Tartarugalzinho areas of the State of
Amapa in Northern Brazil. The Hg contents are high in the upper horizons
of the soil profiles (100-300 mug kg(-1)), and decrease to less than 100
mug kg(-1) at depths of 200 or 300 cm. The higher levels of Hg are
associated with higher Fe concentrations, particularly in the
ferruginous accumulations as mottles and nodules. For each horizon of
the soil profile, balance calculations were used to distinguish the
amount of mercury naturally accumulated from rocks through lateritic
pedogenesis (lithogenic mercury) from the anthropogenic mercury
introduced in the profile through atmospheric contamination. The results
show that the anthropogenic contribution is significant in the upper
horizons (up to 95{\%}{\%} of the total Hg), and decreases downward in the
soil profile. Mercury burdens were calculated for soil profiles in both
upslope (272 880 and 217 440 mug m(-2) for the first 70 cm) and
downslope positions (118 800 and 182 160 {\%} mug m(-2) for the first 70
cm). The loss of Hg in downslope profiles seems to be related to the
natural evolution of iron duricrust into latossols, which has been
brought about by climatic changes toward increasing humidity in the
Amazon since the Tertiary.},

In sediment, the average Hg concentrations varied between 33 ± 17 ng g-1 and 106 ± 78 ng g-1, in samples collected during the rainy and dry season, respectively. The same averages were also found for soil samples (35 ± 14 and 109 ± 61 ng g -1). In water, the total Hg concentration varied between {\textless} 1.1 and 24.0 ng L-1. In piscivore fish, up to 943 $\mu$ g Hg kg-1 was found. Our results show that all compartments undergo Hg contamination, in view of the levels found in pristine environments. Water contamination seems to be due mainly to diffuse processes of soil erosion and suspension of river bed sediment during the rainy season. Also untreated wastewaters generated by industrial activities and from domestic sewage appear to be potential non-point sources in the most industrialized and populated part of the basin. On the other hand, atmospheric transport of mercury originating from the Campinas Metropolitan Region could be another source of mercury contamination, especially in the basin headwaters. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

The average mercury flux in deforested sites (13.7±10.3 pmol m-2 h -1) was significantly higher than in forest sites (0.1±1.8 pmol m-2 h-1). Our results showed that deforestation could be responsible for significantly increasing soil Hg emissions, mainly because of the high soil temperatures reached in deforested sites.

The inorganic As speciation is carried out using mild conditions for hydride formation, such as slightly acid pH media (4.50) and low tetrahydridoborate(1-) concentration (0.1{\%} (w/v)). Limits of detection and quantification of 2.0 and 6.6 $\mu$g L-1 of iAs(III) are obtained using optimized conditions. Additionally, microwave-assisted extraction using water as solvent is carried out to provide the appropriate environment for As species extraction as well as impeding inter-conversion between species. With these analytical strategies, As was accurately determined (at 99.9{\%} confidence level) in water and plankton samples. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

No significant difference was observed between the concentrations found at the two sampling areas and the mean values were 7.0 ± 5.8 ng m -3 (TGM) and 0.4 ± 0.3 ng m-3 (TPM). The analysis of the diel variability showed higher TGM concentrations during the day, which could be related to more intense anthropogenic activity during the day. Atmospheric dispersion processes could also explain some seasonal variation observed in TGM concentrations. For TPM concentrations a decreasing trend was observed during the rainy season, which could be explained by the removal of particles by wet deposition. The concentrations of TGM and TPM found in this study were of the same order of magnitude of those recorded in some highly industrialized regions of the northern hemisphere. These data show that emissions from the most industrialized Brazilian regions, and probably from similar regions in other countries of the southern hemisphere, should also be assessed and integrated into the global anthropogenic mercury emission assessment. {\textcopyright}2006 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu{\'{i}}mica.},

Fire liberates a portion of this mercury; however, little is known about the long-term release of mercury post deforestation. We conducted two large-scale experiments to study this phenomenon. In upstate New York, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored continually using a Teflon dynamic surface flux chamber for two-weeks before and after cutting of the canopy on the edge of a deciduous forest. In Brazil, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored in an intact Ombrophilous Open forest and an adjacent field site both before and after the field site was cleared by burning. In the intact forest, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged-0.73±1.84ngm-2h-1 (24-h monitoring) at the New York site, and 0.33±0.09ngm-2h-1 (daytime-only) at the Brazil site. After deforestation, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged 9.13±2.08ngm-2h-1 in New York and 21.2±0.35ngm-2h-1 at the Brazil site prior to burning. Gaseous mercury emissions averaged 74.9±0.73ngm-2h-1 after burning of the cut forest in Brazil. Extrapolating our data, measured over several weeks to months, to a full year period, deforested soil is estimated to release an additional 2.30gha-1yr-1 of gaseous mercury to the atmosphere in the Brazilian experiment and 0.41gha-1yr-1 in the New York experiment. In Brazil, this represents an additional 50{\%} of the mercury load released during the fire itself. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Forests represent an important role in the control of atmospheric
emissions through carbon capture. However, in forest fires, the carbon
stored during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. The carbon
quantification, in forest burning, is important for the development of
measures for its control. The aim of this study was to quantify CO2 and
CO emissions of forest fires in Western Amazonia. In this paper, results
are described of forest fire experiments conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul
and Rio Branco, state of Acre, and Candeias do Jamari, state of
Rondonia, Brazil. These cities are located in the Western portion of the
Brazilian Amazon region. The biomass content per hectare, in the virgin
forest, was measured by indirect methods using formulas with parameters
of forest inventories in the central hectare of the test site. The
combustion completeness was estimated by randomly selecting 10{\%} of the
total logs and twelve 2 x 2 m(2) areas along three transects and
examining their consumption rates by the fire. The logs were used to
determine the combustion completeness of the larger materials
(characteristic diameters larger than 10 cm) and the 2 x 2 m(2) areas to
determine the combustion completeness of small-size materials (those
with characteristic diameters lower than 10 cm) and the. The overall
biomass consumption by fire was estimated to be 40.0{\%}, 41.2{\%} and
26.2{\%}, in Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Branco and Candeias do Jamari,
respectively. Considering that the combustion gases of carbon in open
fires contain approximately 90.0{\%} of CO2 and 10.0{\%} of CO in volumetric
basis, the average emission rates of these gases by the burning process,
in the three sites, were estimated as 191 +/- 46.7 t ha(-1) and 13.5 +/-

The final conditions (TiO2 concentration of the coating solution: 10{\%}; Fe(II): 7.0 mg l-1; solar exposure time: 120 min) were applied to natural water samples spiked with 500 $\mu$g l-1 As(III) in order to verify the influence of natural water matrix. After treatment, As(III) and total As concentrations were lower than the limit of quantitation (2 $\mu$g l-1) of the voltammetric method used, showing a removal over 99{\%}, and giving evidence that As(III) was effectively oxidized to As(V). The results obtained demonstrated that TiO2 can be easily immobilized on a PET surface in order to perform As(III) oxidation in water and that this TiO2 immobilization, combined with coprecipitation of arsenic on Fe(III) hydroxides(oxides) could be an efficient way for inorganic arsenic removal from groundwaters. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

25{\%} of the world's total rainforest, few data are available about these

were determined for vegetation, litter and soil before and after the
fires. The data show that only Hg present in the aboveground vegetation

observed. Before the fire, the Hg stored in the vegetation (logs,
branches, leaves and litter) ranged from 3.7 to 4.0 g ha(-1) while 1.8 g

m(-2) h(-1) - night. At the deforested site, the mercury fluxes were
higher and always positive: maximum of 26 pmol m(-2) h(-1) - day and 17
pmol m(-2) h(-1) - night. Our results showed that deforestation could be
responsible for significantly increasing soil Hg emissions, mainly
because of the high soil temperatures reached at deforested sites.},

@article{Peruchi2015,
abstract = {Fluoroquinolones are potent antibacterial agents that are active against a wide range of pathogenic organisms and are widely used in veterinary medicine. Fluoroquinolones and their metabolites may reach the soil through animal excreta or manure and may contaminate water and soils. The degree of sorption of these antimicrobials to soils varies widely, as does the mobility of these drugs. In the present study, sorption of norfloxacin in four soils of the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo was investigated with batch equilibrium experiments. A strong matrix effect on the chromatographic determination of norfloxacin was verified. Sorption kinetics were best fit by a pseudo second-order model (r{\textgreater}0.99), and sorption/desorption isotherms were well fit by the Freundlich model in log form (r{\textgreater}0.97). Norfloxacin showed high affinity for soil particles, with KF sorption values ranging from 643 to 2410 $\mu$g(1-1/n)(cm(3))(1/n)g(-1) and KF desorption values ranging from 686 to 2468 $\mu$g(1-1/n)(cm(3))(1/n)g(-1). The high desorption KF values indicate that norfloxacin is highly immobile in the evaluated soils.},
