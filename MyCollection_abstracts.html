<blockquote><font size="-1">
Experiments in saturated soil columns were performed to investigate the transport and retention of 25 nm and 75 nm silver nanoparticles stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-AgNPs) in two Brazilian soils (sandy and sandy-clay). The normalized concentration of the PVP-AgNPs was obtained through a flow injection analysis method based on the surface plasmon ressonance effect of the metallic nanoparticles. The use of the ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) allows a rapid and low-cost analysis. The obtained breakthrough curves (BCs) were modeled with a deterministic model of solute transport in steady conditions of water flow and considering two regions of non-physical equilibrium; this model allowed the determination of the hydrodynamic parameters. It was found that the process occurs in condition of non-equilibrium, with a low mass transfer for larger NP, and that the process is predominantly advective and affected by the pore size of the soil packed in the columns. The BCs for PVP-AgNPs obtained by UV–Vis spectroscopy were compared with the BCs obtained by ICP-MS and with BCs of the bromide anion, confirming that the nanoparticles have a low retention and few modifications when transported through the soil column. These PVP-AgNPs are highly mobile and can be transported through the studied tropical soils, representing a potential environmental problem, due to the possibility of these materials reaching groundwater. On the contrary, the conservative behavior of PVP-AgNPs in the studied tropical soils, indicates its potential use as tracers, substituting the bromide anion which has been demonstrated to be not a good tracer in the same conditions.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Mercury emissions from artisanal gold mining operations occurring in roughly 80 developing countries are a major workplace health hazard for millions of people as well as the largest contributor to global mercury pollution. There are no portable, cheap, and rapid methods able to inform workers or health practitioners of mercury exposure on site in remote locations. In this work, a proof of concept for a miniaturized mercury sampler, prepared by the direct reduction of gold into the porous nanostructures of Vycor glass (PVG), is introduced. Mercury retention on the PVG/Au sampler induces significant color changes, due to the formation of Au-Hg amalgam that affects the surface plasmon resonance characteristics of the material. The color change can potentially be quantified by the analysis of pictures obtained with a cell phone camera rapidly and onsite. Laboratory experiments showed the viability of using PVG/Au as passive sampler for monitoring of Hg°. PVG/Au samplers were then deployed in an artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) operations in Burkina Faso and it was able to indicate personal mercury exposures. The amount of mercury quantified in the samplers for all miners was higher than the current personal exposure limit set by the US Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA).

Forests represent an important role in the control of atmospheric
emissions through carbon capture. However, in forest fires, the carbon
stored during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. The carbon
quantification, in forest burning, is important for the development of
measures for its control. The aim of this study was to quantify CO2 and
CO emissions of forest fires in Western Amazonia. In this paper, results
are described of forest fire experiments conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul
and Rio Branco, state of Acre, and Candeias do Jamari, state of
Rondonia, Brazil. These cities are located in the Western portion of the
Brazilian Amazon region. The biomass content per hectare, in the virgin
forest, was measured by indirect methods using formulas with parameters
of forest inventories in the central hectare of the test site. The
combustion completeness was estimated by randomly selecting 10% of the
total logs and twelve 2 x 2 m(2) areas along three transects and
examining their consumption rates by the fire. The logs were used to
determine the combustion completeness of the larger materials
(characteristic diameters larger than 10 cm) and the 2 x 2 m(2) areas to
determine the combustion completeness of small-size materials (those
with characteristic diameters lower than 10 cm) and the. The overall
biomass consumption by fire was estimated to be 40.0%, 41.2% and
26.2%, in Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Branco and Candeias do Jamari,
respectively. Considering that the combustion gases of carbon in open
fires contain approximately 90.0% of CO2 and 10.0% of CO in volumetric
basis, the average emission rates of these gases by the burning process,
in the three sites, were estimated as 191 +/- 46.7 t ha(-1) and 13.5 +/-
3.3 t ha(-1), respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fluoroquinolones are potent antibacterial agents that are active against a wide range of pathogenic organisms and are widely used in veterinary medicine. Fluoroquinolones and their metabolites may reach the soil through animal excreta or manure and may contaminate water and soils. The degree of sorption of these antimicrobials to soils varies widely, as does the mobility of these drugs. In the present study, sorption of norfloxacin in four soils of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo was investigated with batch equilibrium experiments. A strong matrix effect on the chromatographic determination of norfloxacin was verified. Sorption kinetics were best fit by a pseudo second-order model (r0.99), and sorption/desorption isotherms were well fit by the Freundlich model in log form (r0.97). Norfloxacin showed high affinity for soil particles, with KF sorption values ranging from 643 to 2410 &mu;g(1-1/n)(cm(3))(1/n)g(-1) and KF desorption values ranging from 686 to 2468 &mu;g(1-1/n)(cm(3))(1/n)g(-1). The high desorption KF values indicate that norfloxacin is highly immobile in the evaluated soils.

Mercury stored in forests can be volatilized to the atmosphere during fires. Many factors influence this process such as mercury concentration, vegetation loading and the soil temperature reached during the fire. We quantified mercury emissions from biomass and soil during a prescribed fire in Brazil using the difference in mercury burden in vegetation and soil before and after burning, and data were critically compared with those previously obtained in a similar experiment in another part of the Amazonia. The calculated mercury emission factor was 4.1±1.4gHgha-1, with the main part (78%) originating from litterfall and O-horizon, and only 14% associated with live biomass. When considering the fuel burned loading, the emission factor ranged from 40 to 53&mu;gHgkg-1.

Forest ecosystems are a sink of atmospheric mercury, trapping the metal in the canopy, and storing it in the forest floor after litter fall. Fire liberates a portion of this mercury; however, little is known about the long-term release of mercury post deforestation. We conducted two large-scale experiments to study this phenomenon. In upstate New York, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored continually using a Teflon dynamic surface flux chamber for two-weeks before and after cutting of the canopy on the edge of a deciduous forest. In Brazil, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored in an intact Ombrophilous Open forest and an adjacent field site both before and after the field site was cleared by burning. In the intact forest, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged-0.73±1.84ngm-2h-1 (24-h monitoring) at the New York site, and 0.33±0.09ngm-2h-1 (daytime-only) at the Brazil site. After deforestation, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged 9.13±2.08ngm-2h-1 in New York and 21.2±0.35ngm-2h-1 at the Brazil site prior to burning. Gaseous mercury emissions averaged 74.9±0.73ngm-2h-1 after burning of the cut forest in Brazil. Extrapolating our data, measured over several weeks to months, to a full year period, deforested soil is estimated to release an additional 2.30gha-1yr-1 of gaseous mercury to the atmosphere in the Brazilian experiment and 0.41gha-1yr-1 in the New York experiment. In Brazil, this represents an additional 50% of the mercury load released during the fire itself.  2014 The Authors.

Several recent studies have indicated that forest fires are likely to

to the atmosphere. Although the Amazon forest accounts for approximately
25% of the world's total rainforest, few data are available about these
emissions. The emissions of mercury from prescribed fires of two 4-ha
plots of Amazon forest were investigated. Hg concentration and Hg burden
were determined for vegetation, litter and soil before and after the
fires. The data show that only Hg present in the aboveground vegetation
and in the O-horizon was volatilised; no significant soil emission was
observed. Before the fire, the Hg stored in the vegetation (logs,
branches, leaves and litter) ranged from 3.7 to 4.0 g ha(-1) while 1.8 g
ha(-1) was found in the O-horizon. The mass balance calculations of the
present work indicate an average Hg emission of 3.5 g ha(-1) due to
forest fires, with 1.6 ha(-1) originating from O-horizon and 1.9 from
above ground vegetation. On the base of the average annual deforestation
rate of the Brazilian Amazon between 2000 and 2008, an annual Hg
emission of 6.7 Mg yr(-1) was estimated. Citation: Michelazzo, P. A. M.,

Despite the low level of industrial activity and human density, Hg concentration in the Negro River basin is relatively high. Soil enriched with naturally high Hg concentrations and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of the metal in this watershed. Differences between invasive and evasive fluxes at the water/air and soil/air interfaces indicate Hg accumulation in the basin at a rate of 39.9 t y-1. The type of soil, which is the main source of mercury for the water bodies, the hydrological cycle with floods and dry periods, act markedly on the water redox chemistry. A complex interaction between many seasonable variables such as solar intensity, water pH, age of the naturally occurring organic matter and the hydrological cycle alter the redox characteristics of these black water bodies, thus markedly affecting the consumption of Hg0 and the degradation of methylmercury present in the water. Although methylation is favored in black waters, photodegradation counterpoints this formation, thus regulating the methylmercury burden in the water column. 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica.

Arsenic oxidation (As(III) to As(V)) and As(V) removal from water were assessed by using TiO2 immobilized in PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles in the presence of natural sunlight and iron salts. The effect of many parameters was sequentially studied: TiO2 concentration of the coating solution, Fe(II) concentration, pH, solar irradiation time; dissolved organic carbon concentration. The final conditions (TiO2 concentration of the coating solution: 10%; Fe(II): 7.0 mg l-1; solar exposure time: 120 min) were applied to natural water samples spiked with 500 &mu;g l-1 As(III) in order to verify the influence of natural water matrix. After treatment, As(III) and total As concentrations were lower than the limit of quantitation (2 &mu;g l-1) of the voltammetric method used, showing a removal over 99%, and giving evidence that As(III) was effectively oxidized to As(V). The results obtained demonstrated that TiO2 can be easily immobilized on a PET surface in order to perform As(III) oxidation in water and that this TiO2 immobilization, combined with coprecipitation of arsenic on Fe(III) hydroxides(oxides) could be an efficient way for inorganic arsenic removal from groundwaters.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentrations of Total Gaseous Mercury (TGM) and Total Particulate Mercury (TPM) were monitored during the 2002-2003 rainy and dry seasons at two sampling points (industrial and residential areas) of the Campinas Metropolitan Region. No significant difference was observed between the concentrations found at the two sampling areas and the mean values were 7.0 ± 5.8 ng m -3 (TGM) and 0.4 ± 0.3 ng m-3 (TPM). The analysis of the diel variability showed higher TGM concentrations during the day, which could be related to more intense anthropogenic activity during the day. Atmospheric dispersion processes could also explain some seasonal variation observed in TGM concentrations. For TPM concentrations a decreasing trend was observed during the rainy season, which could be explained by the removal of particles by wet deposition. The concentrations of TGM and TPM found in this study were of the same order of magnitude of those recorded in some highly industrialized regions of the northern hemisphere. These data show that emissions from the most industrialized Brazilian regions, and probably from similar regions in other countries of the southern hemisphere, should also be assessed and integrated into the global anthropogenic mercury emission assessment. 2006 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica.

A sampling and analysis program has been completed between 1995 and 1998 in order to determine mercury concentrations in water, sediments, soils and fish in the Piracicaba river basin, one of the most populated and industrialized regions in Brazil. In sediment, the average Hg concentrations varied between 33 ± 17 ng g-1 and 106 ± 78 ng g-1, in samples collected during the rainy and dry season, respectively. The same averages were also found for soil samples (35 ± 14 and 109 ± 61 ng g -1). In water, the total Hg concentration varied between  1.1 and 24.0 ng L-1. In piscivore fish, up to 943 &mu; g Hg kg-1 was found. Our results show that all compartments undergo Hg contamination, in view of the levels found in pristine environments. Water contamination seems to be due mainly to diffuse processes of soil erosion and suspension of river bed sediment during the rainy season. Also untreated wastewaters generated by industrial activities and from domestic sewage appear to be potential non-point sources in the most industrialized and populated part of the basin. On the other hand, atmospheric transport of mercury originating from the Campinas Metropolitan Region could be another source of mercury contamination, especially in the basin headwaters.

An investigation of air/surface exchange of mercury, performed at the Negro River Basin, (Amazonian region) in January 2003 and January 2004, is presented. Five sites were investigated: a flooding primary forest, a non-flooding primary forest and three deforested areas. The fluxes were estimated by using a dynamic flux chamber with sampling times varying between 6 and 12 h. The average mercury flux in deforested sites (13.7±10.3 pmol m-2 h -1) was significantly higher than in forest sites (0.1±1.8 pmol m-2 h-1). Our results showed that deforestation could be responsible for significantly increasing soil Hg emissions, mainly because of the high soil temperatures reached in deforested sites. Atmospheric gaseous mercury concentrations were generally low when compared with background areas from the Northern hemisphere.

This work focuses on the behaviour of mercury in lateritic soil profiles
found in the Serra do Navio and Tartarugalzinho areas of the State of
Amapa in Northern Brazil. The Hg contents are high in the upper horizons
of the soil profiles (100-300 mug kg(-1)), and decrease to less than 100
mug kg(-1) at depths of 200 or 300 cm. The higher levels of Hg are
associated with higher Fe concentrations, particularly in the
ferruginous accumulations as mottles and nodules. For each horizon of
the soil profile, balance calculations were used to distinguish the
amount of mercury naturally accumulated from rocks through lateritic
pedogenesis (lithogenic mercury) from the anthropogenic mercury
introduced in the profile through atmospheric contamination. The results
show that the anthropogenic contribution is significant in the upper
horizons (up to 95%% of the total Hg), and decreases downward in the
soil profile. Mercury burdens were calculated for soil profiles in both
upslope (272 880 and 217 440 mug m(-2) for the first 70 cm) and
downslope positions (118 800 and 182 160 % mug m(-2) for the first 70
cm). The loss of Hg in downslope profiles seems to be related to the
natural evolution of iron duricrust into latossols, which has been
brought about by climatic changes toward increasing humidity in the
Amazon since the Tertiary.

deforestation and activities related to manganese mining. The catchment

the natural area, the inputs were 18.2 mu g m(-2) year(-1) in rainwater
and 72 mu g m(-2) year(-1) in throughfall. This enrichment was
attributed to dry deposition. The stream output of 2.9 mu g m(-2)
year(-1) indicates that Hg is being recycled within the forest as other
chemical species or is being retained by the soil system, as confirmed
by the cumulative Hg burden in the 0-10 cm surface layer, which was 36
480 mu g m When the disturbed area of the catchment was included, the
stream output was 9.3 mu g m(-2), clearly indicating the impact of the

soils and sediments collected in the Vila Nova river (up to 2 mg.kg(-1))
when compared to background values (0.3 mg.kg(-1)) for this region. An
enrichment factor was calculated, using Al as a normalizing factor. It
showed values up to 8 in sediments of the Vila Nova river basin,

 Mercury in human and environmental samples from two lakes in Amapa,
  Brazilian Amazon.
 <em>AMBIO</em>, 28(4):296--301, jun 1999.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Total Hg was determined in sediment, piscivorous fish and human hair
from two similar lake areas in Amapa State, Brazilian Amazon: Duas Bocas
Lake (DBL), influenced by Hg releases from gold mining; and Pracuuba
Lake (PL), a pristine site 15 km to the north. In DBL, Hg profiles in
sediments clearly documented the evolution of Hg pollution, and Hg was
significantly higher in fish and human hair than in FL. (203)Hg
methylation rates in sediments and methylmercury proportions in fish
suggest a high Hg bioavailability in both lakes. Average daily fish
intake is approx. 200 g, and at DBL 95% of fish samples (N = 40)
exceeded the 150 ng Hg g(-1) safety limit. Hg in human hair averaged 28
mu g g(-1) (N = 15), i.e. a level at which neurotoxic effects have been
found. However, Hg was also high in the pristine FL, where 67-100% (N =
34) of the fish had levels that exceeded the safety limit, and 87% of
hair samples (N = 15) had above 10 ng Hg g(-1). In both areas, children
and pregnant women should be advised to consume nonpiscivorous and/or
small fish species. Hg levels should also be investigated in other areas
of the Amapa coastal plain.

 On-line microwave-assisted sample decomposition for lead
  determination in fish slurry samples by electrothermal atomic absorption
  spectrometry.
 <em>JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY</em>, 8(1):39--45, 1997.
[&nbsp;<a href="MyCollection_bib.html#ISI:A1997WP60200008">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
An on-line microwave-assisted decomposition procedure for the
determination of lead in fish is proposed. 300 mu L slurry and 400 mu L
of a 6 mol L(-1) HNO3 solution were simultaneously injected, and the
mixture was positioned inside a microwave oven. The decomposed sample
inside the flushing solution was collected in the autosampler cup of a
graphite furnace. The proposed procedure covered the 2.5 to 25 mu g
L(-1) Pb range and presented a detection limit of 0.72 mu g L(-1) Pb.
Precision expressed as RSD, was 10.5% (n = 20) for repeatability and
14.3% (n = 10) for reproducibility. Accuracy was assessed using
standard reference material, and also by comparing the results to a
nitric-perchloric decomposition procedure.

 Direct determination of mercury in sediments by atomic absorption
  spectrometry.
 <em>JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY</em>, 12(10):1231--1234,
  1997.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
A pyrolysis chamber is described for the direct determination of mercury
in sediments by atomic absorption spectrometry, The finely, ground and
dried sample is weighed (2.0-60.0 mg), transferred to a quartz cup,
inserted in a pyrolysis chamber and heated at 1100 degrees C for 30 s by
means of three focused, infrared lamps in the presence of an air stream
as-the carrier gas, Interfering substances are destroyed by a precolumn
containing alumina, silica and copper(li) oxide, and the released
mercury is amalgamated on to a gold-coated collector, Mercury vapour is
later measured by AAS after thermal desorption, Calibration is easily
performed by flow injection, in which known volumes of mercury-saturated
air are introduced into the same air carrier stream, The absolute
detection limit was 0.26 ng Hg and the relative standard deviation of
measurements (n=12) from a typical 4.0 mg sample was about 7%, By
applying a t-test, there was no significant difference at the 5%
probability level between the results obtained with the proposed method
and those certified or recommended for NIST materials, One analysis
takes only 2 min, including sample weighing.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Lyophilized fish tissues and bottom sediments were decomposed in a
microwave oven, The behavior of the inner pressure was observed for two
different digestion solutions in absence of samples, by varying the
number of digestion vessels, For fish analysis, effects of fat content,
sample amount and volume of HNO3 were investigated, Decomposition of the
sediment samples was studied by varying sample amount, carbon content
and the volume of the digestion solution, In all situations, pressure
profile curves were built up, Samples were analyzed by flow injection
cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry, Two programs were checked by
using standard reference material (IAEA-350) for fish muscular tissue
and laboratory intercomparison (Laboratory of Biofisica, UFRJ/RJ) for
sediment samples, The fish fat content had no influence on the yield of
the solubilization process, but the percentage of carbon in the
sediments influenced the behavior of the sample digestion, In both
cases, recoveries higher than 90% were calculated, The account the
routine analysis, according to an automated mercury determination.

The chemical composition of the phycocolloids from two Senegalese red
algae Anatheca montagnei and Meristotheca senegalensis (Soleriaceae) has
been compared with the hybrid iota-kappa carrageenan from commercial
Euchema spinosum. A partially desulfated major iota carrageenan was
identified. The milk strengths of gels from the Senegalese species were
similar to those from Euchema spinosum suggesting potential economical
applications.
