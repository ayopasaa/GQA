2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica.Sulfonamides are among the most widely employed antibacterial in veterinary medicine. Because a substantial proportion of sulfonamides are excreted unchanged as parent compounds after administration or are excreted as their metabolites through urine and feces, their presence in soils is a matter of concern. Adsorption and desorption are important processes that influence the transport, transformation and bioavailability of antimicrobials in soils, and data related to sorption capacity are therefore needed for environmental risk assessments. The sorption potential of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) was assessed in four Brazilians soils using batch equilibrium experiments. The adsorption/desorption data fit well Freundlich isotherms. The sorption coefficients (KD) ranged from 1.00 to 4.48 cm3 g-1, and the Freundlich adsorption coefficient (KF) ranged from 1.89 to 5.63 &mu;g1-1/n (cm3)1/n g-1 showing that SCP adsorption is generally low in the studied soils. The results were compared with previously published data obtained for the sorption of other sulfonamides in the same four soils.

 2015, Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Mercury is toxic for human health and one of the main routes of exposure is through consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish. The objective of this work was to assess the possible mercury contamination of bivalves (Anomalocardia brasiliana, Lucina pectinata, Callinectes sapidus), crustacean (C. sapidus) and fish (Bagre marinus and Diapterus rhombeus) collected on Salinas da Margarida, BA (Brazil), a region which carciniculture, fishing and shellfish extraction are the most important economic activities. The effect of cooking on Hg concentration in the samples was also studied. The results showed that Hg concentration was generally higher in the cooked samples than in raw samples. This increase can be related to the effect of Hg pre-concentration, formation of complexes involving mercury species and sulfhydryl groups present in tissues and/or loss of water and fat. The highest concentrations were found in B. marinus samples ranging 837.0-1585.3 &mu;g kgsup-1/sup, which exceeded those recommended by Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). In addition, Hg values found in the other samples also suggest the monitoring of the Hg concentrations in seafood consumed from the region.

 2016 Elsevier Ltd.Forests represent an important role in the control of atmospheric emissions through carbon capture. However, in forest fires, the carbon stored during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. The carbon quantification, in forest burning, is important for the development of measures for its control. The aim of this study was to quantify CO2 and CO emissions of forest fires in Western Amazonia. In this paper, results are described of forest fire experiments conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul and Rio Branco, state of Acre, and Candeias do Jamari, state of Rond&ocirc;nia, Brazil. These cities are located in the Western portion of the Brazilian Amazon region. The biomass content per hectare, in the virgin forest, was measured by indirect methods using formulas with parameters of forest inventories in the central hectare of the test site. The combustion completeness was estimated by randomly selecting 10% of the total logs and twelve 2 × 2 m2 areas along three transects and examining their consumption rates by the fire. The logs were used to determine the combustion completeness of the larger materials (characteristic diameters larger than 10 cm) and the 2 × 2 m2 areas to determine the combustion completeness of small-size materials (those with characteristic diameters lower than 10 cm) and the. The overall biomass consumption by fire was estimated to be 40.0%, 41.2% and 26.2%, in Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Branco and Candeias do Jamari, respectively. Considering that the combustion gases of carbon in open fires contain approximately 90.0% of CO2 and 10.0% of CO in volumetric basis, the average emission rates of these gases by the burning process, in the three sites, were estimated as 191 ± 46.7 t ha-1 and 13.5 ± 3.3 t ha-1, respectively.

 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug that is regularly employed in veterinary medicine. In this work, the sorption and desorption of IVM in two Brazilian soils (N1-sand and S2-clay) as well as its leaching capacity, dissipation under aerobic conditions, and degradation in aqueous solution by photocatalysis with TiO2 in suspension were evaluated. The kinetic sorption curves of IVM were adjusted to a pseudo-second-order model. The sorption and desorption data were well fitted with the Freundlich isotherms in the log form (r  0.96). The Freundlich sorption coefficient (KFads) and the Freundlich desorption coefficient (KFdes) were 77.7 and 120 &mu;g1−1/n(cm3)1/ng−1 and 74.5 and 138 &mu;g1−1/n(cm3)1/ng−1, for soils N1 and S2, respectively. A greater leaching capacity of IVM was observed for the sandy soil N1 than for the clay soil S2. Under aerobic conditions, the dissipation (DT50) at 19.3 °C was 15.5 days (soil N1) and 11.5 days (soil S2). Photocatalysis with UVC and TiO2 in suspension resulted in the degradation of 98 % of IVM (500 &mu;g L−1) in water in 600 s. The toxicity (Daphnia similis) of the solutions submitted to the photocatalytic process was completely eliminated after 10 min.

Fluoroquinolones and their metabolites may reach the soil through animal excreta or manure and may contaminate water and soils. The degree of sorption of these antimicrobials to soils varies widely, as does the mobility of these drugs. In the present study, sorption of norfloxacin in four soils of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo was investigated with batch equilibrium experiments. A strong matrix effect on the chromatographic determination of norfloxacin was verified. Sorption kinetics were best fit by a pseudo second-order model (r0.99), and sorption/desorption isotherms were well fit by the Freundlich model in log form (r0.97). Norfloxacin showed high affinity for soil particles, with KF sorption values ranging from 643 to 2410&mu;g1-1/n(cm3)1/ng-1 and KF desorption values ranging from 686 to 2468&mu;g1-1/n(cm3)1/ng-1.

Forest ecosystems are a sink of atmospheric mercury, trapping the metal in the canopy, and storing it in the forest floor after litter fall. Fire liberates a portion of this mercury; however, little is known about the long-term release of mercury post deforestation. We conducted two large-scale experiments to study this phenomenon. In upstate New York, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored continually using a Teflon dynamic surface flux chamber for two-weeks before and after cutting of the canopy on the edge of a deciduous forest. In Brazil, gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored in an intact Ombrophilous Open forest and an adjacent field site both before and after the field site was cleared by burning. In the intact forest, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged-0.73±1.84ngm-2h-1 (24-h monitoring) at the New York site, and 0.33±0.09ngm-2h-1 (daytime-only) at the Brazil site. After deforestation, gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged 9.13±2.08ngm-2h-1 in New York and 21.2±0.35ngm-2h-1 at the Brazil site prior to burning. Gaseous mercury emissions averaged 74.9±0.73ngm-2h-1 after burning of the cut forest in Brazil. Extrapolating our data, measured over several weeks to months, to a full year period, deforested soil is estimated to release an additional 2.30gha-1yr-1 of gaseous mercury to the atmosphere in the Brazilian experiment and 0.41gha-1yr-1 in the New York experiment. In Brazil, this represents an additional 50% of the mercury load released during the fire itself.  2014 The Authors.

Mercury stored in forests can be volatilized to the atmosphere during fires. Many factors influence this process such as mercury concentration, vegetation loading and the soil temperature reached during the fire. We quantified mercury emissions from biomass and soil during a prescribed fire in Brazil using the difference in mercury burden in vegetation and soil before and after burning, and data were critically compared with those previously obtained in a similar experiment in another part of the Amazonia. The calculated mercury emission factor was 4.1±1.4gHgha-1, with the main part (78%) originating from litterfall and O-horizon, and only 14% associated with live biomass. When considering the fuel burned loading, the emission factor ranged from 40 to 53&mu;gHgkg-1.

Copyright  2010 by the American Geophysical Union.Several recent studies have indicated that forest fires are likely to re-emit important quantities of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg) to the atmosphere. Although the Amazon forest accounts for approximately 25% of the world's total rainforest, few data are available about these emissions. The emissions of mercury from prescribed fires of two 4-ha plots of Amazon forest were investigated. Hg concentration and Hg burden were determined for vegetation, litter and soil before and after the fires. The data show that only Hg present in the aboveground vegetation and in the O-horizon was volatilised; no significant soil emission was observed. Before the fire, the Hg stored in the vegetation (logs, branches, leaves and litter) ranged from 3.7 to 4.0 g ha-1 while 1.8 g ha-1 was found in the O-horizon. The mass balance calculations of the present work indicate an average Hg emission of 3.5 g ha-1 due to forest fires, with 1.6 ha-1 originating from O-horizon and 1.9 from above ground vegetation. On the base of the average annual deforestation rate of the Brazilian Amazon between 2000 and 2008, an annual Hg emission of 6.7 Mg yr-1 was estimated.

Despite the low level of industrial activity and human density, Hg concentration in the Negro River basin is relatively high. Soil enriched with naturally high Hg concentrations and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of the metal in this watershed. Differences between invasive and evasive fluxes at the water/air and soil/air interfaces indicate Hg accumulation in the basin at a rate of 39.9 t y-1. The type of soil, which is the main source of mercury for the water bodies, the hydrological cycle with floods and dry periods, act markedly on the water redox chemistry. A complex interaction between many seasonable variables such as solar intensity, water pH, age of the naturally occurring organic matter and the hydrological cycle alter the redox characteristics of these black water bodies, thus markedly affecting the consumption of Hg0 and the degradation of methylmercury present in the water. Although methylation is favored in black waters, photodegradation counterpoints this formation, thus regulating the methylmercury burden in the water column. 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica.

The final conditions (TiO2 concentration of the coating solution: 10%; Fe(II): 7.0 mg l-1; solar exposure time: 120 min) were applied to natural water samples spiked with 500 &mu;g l-1 As(III) in order to verify the influence of natural water matrix. After treatment, As(III) and total As concentrations were lower than the limit of quantitation (2 &mu;g l-1) of the voltammetric method used, showing a removal over 99%, and giving evidence that As(III) was effectively oxidized to As(V). The results obtained demonstrated that TiO2 can be easily immobilized on a PET surface in order to perform As(III) oxidation in water and that this TiO2 immobilization, combined with coprecipitation of arsenic on Fe(III) hydroxides(oxides) could be an efficient way for inorganic arsenic removal from groundwaters.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentrations of Total Gaseous Mercury (TGM) and Total Particulate Mercury (TPM) were monitored during the 2002-2003 rainy and dry seasons at two sampling points (industrial and residential areas) of the Campinas Metropolitan Region. No significant difference was observed between the concentrations found at the two sampling areas and the mean values were 7.0 ± 5.8 ng m -3 (TGM) and 0.4 ± 0.3 ng m-3 (TPM). The analysis of the diel variability showed higher TGM concentrations during the day, which could be related to more intense anthropogenic activity during the day. Atmospheric dispersion processes could also explain some seasonal variation observed in TGM concentrations. For TPM concentrations a decreasing trend was observed during the rainy season, which could be explained by the removal of particles by wet deposition. The concentrations of TGM and TPM found in this study were of the same order of magnitude of those recorded in some highly industrialized regions of the northern hemisphere. These data show that emissions from the most industrialized Brazilian regions, and probably from similar regions in other countries of the southern hemisphere, should also be assessed and integrated into the global anthropogenic mercury emission assessment. 2006 Sociedade Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica.

A sampling and analysis program has been completed between 1995 and 1998 in order to determine mercury concentrations in water, sediments, soils and fish in the Piracicaba river basin, one of the most populated and industrialized regions in Brazil. In sediment, the average Hg concentrations varied between 33 ± 17 ng g-1 and 106 ± 78 ng g-1, in samples collected during the rainy and dry season, respectively. The same averages were also found for soil samples (35 ± 14 and 109 ± 61 ng g -1). In water, the total Hg concentration varied between  1.1 and 24.0 ng L-1. In piscivore fish, up to 943 &mu; g Hg kg-1 was found. Our results show that all compartments undergo Hg contamination, in view of the levels found in pristine environments. Water contamination seems to be due mainly to diffuse processes of soil erosion and suspension of river bed sediment during the rainy season. Also untreated wastewaters generated by industrial activities and from domestic sewage appear to be potential non-point sources in the most industrialized and populated part of the basin. On the other hand, atmospheric transport of mercury originating from the Campinas Metropolitan Region could be another source of mercury contamination, especially in the basin headwaters.

An investigation of air/surface exchange of mercury, performed at the Negro River Basin, (Amazonian region) in January 2003 and January 2004, is presented. Five sites were investigated: a flooding primary forest, a non-flooding primary forest and three deforested areas. The fluxes were estimated by using a dynamic flux chamber with sampling times varying between 6 and 12 h. The average mercury flux in deforested sites (13.7±10.3 pmol m-2 h -1) was significantly higher than in forest sites (0.1±1.8 pmol m-2 h-1). Our results showed that deforestation could be responsible for significantly increasing soil Hg emissions, mainly because of the high soil temperatures reached in deforested sites. Atmospheric gaseous mercury concentrations were generally low when compared with background areas from the Northern hemisphere.

The other catchment area, CUNHA (between parallels 23° 13 minutes 18 seconds and 23° 16 minutes 10 seconds South and meridians 45° 02 minutes 53 seconds and 45° 02 minutes 53 seconds West), is within a State Reserve of the Atlantic Forest, with 2850 ha, located about 15 km from the ocean, surrounded by rural areas and small villages. PEFI is about 798 m above sea level, while CUNHA is about 1050 m. In this work we examined the monthly litterfall trace metal (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg) fluxes for both catchments during the 2001 dry season (may to September). Trace element concentrations were also determined in soils. CUNHA is characterized by low fluxes and low concentrations in soil, compared with PEFI.

This work focuses on the behaviour of mercury in lateritic soil profiles found in the Serra do Navio and Tartarugalzinho areas of the State of Amap&aacute; in Northern Brazil. The Hg contents are high in the upper horizons of the soil profiles (100-300 &mu;g kg-1), and decrease to less than 100 &mu;g kg-1 at depths of 200 or 300 cm. The higher levels of Hg are associated with higher Fe concentrations, particularly in the ferruginous accumulations as mottles and nodules. For each horizon of the soil profile, balance calculations were used to distinguish the amount of mercury naturally accumulated from rocks through lateritic pedogenesis (lithogenic mercury) from the anthropogenic mercury introduced in the profile through atmospheric contamination. The results show that the anthropogenic contribution is significant in the upper horizons (up to 95% of the total Hg), and decreases downward in the soil profile. Mercury burdens were calculated for soil profiles in both upslope (272 880 and 217 440 &mu;g m-2 for the first 70 cm) and downslope positions (118 800 and 182 160 &mu;g m-2 for the first 70 cm). The loss of Hg in downslope profiles seems to be related to the natural evolution of iron duricrust into latossols, which has been brought about by climatic changes toward increasing humidity in the Amazon since the Tertiary.

Mercury (Hg total) fluxes were calculated for rainwater, throughfall and stream water in a small catchment located in the northeastern region of the Brazilian Amazon (Serra do Navio, Amapa State), whose upper part is covered by a natural rainforest and lower part was altered due to deforestation and activities related to manganese mining. The catchment area is 200 km from the nearest gold mining (garimpo). Minimum and maximum Hg concentrations were measured monthly from October 1996 to September 1997 and were 3.5-23.4 ng l-1 for rainwater, 16.5-82.7 ng l-1 for throughfall (March-August 1997) and 1.2-6.1 and 4.2-18.8 ng l-1 for stream water, in natural and disturbed areas, respectively. In the natural area, the inputs were 18.2 &mu;g m-2 year-1 in rainwater and 72 &mu;g m-2 year-1 in throughfall. This enrichment was attributed to dry deposition. The stream output of 2.9 &mu;g m-2 year-1 indicates that Hg is being recycled within the forest as other chemical species or is being retained by the soil system, as confirmed by the cumulative Hg burden in the 0-10 cm surface layer, which was 36480 &mu;g m-2. When the disturbed area of the catchment was included, the stream output was 9.3 &mu;g m-2, clearly indicating the impact of the deforestation of the lower part of the basin on the release of mercury. The Hg burden in the disturbed area was 7560 &mu;g m-2 for the 0-10 cm surface layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Total mercury contents were determined in the muddy (silt+clay) fraction of the sediments and in the 2 mm fraction of the soils using radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA). The detection limit of the method was 54 &mu;g  kg-1 for soils and 14 &mu;g  kg-1 for sediments when 200 mg of sample were analysed. The Hg results obtained from a comparison between our current method (RNAA) and CV AAS are also presented. Mercury levels showed to be very high in the soils and sediments collected in the Vila Nova river (up to 2 mg  kg-1) when compared to background values (0.3 mg  kg-1) for this region. An enrichment factor was calculated, using Al as a normalizing factor. It showed values up to 8 in sediments of the Vila Nova river basin, indicating a relatively high degree of pollution as compared to the values of about I for the samples of the Igarape Pedra Preta basin.

Total Hg was determined in sediment, piscivorous fish and human hair from two similar lake areas in Amapa State, Brazilian Amazon: Duas Bocas Lake (DBL), influenced by Hg releases from gold mining; and Pracuuba Lake (PL), a pristine site 15 km to the north. In DBL, Hg profiles in sediments clearly documented the evolution of Hg pollution, and Hg was significantly higher in fish and human hair than in PL. 203Hg methylation rates in sediments and methylmercury proportions in fish suggest a high Hg bioavailability in both lakes. Average daily fish intake is approx. 200 g, and at DBL 95% of fish samples (N = 40) exceeded the 150 ng Hg g-1 safety limit. Hg in human hair averaged 28 &mu;g g-1 (N = 15), i.e. a level at which neurotoxic effects have been found. However, Hg was also high in the pristine PL, where 67-100% (N = 34) of the fish had levels that exceeded the safety limit, and 87% of hair samples (N = 15) had above 10 ng Hg g-1. In both areas, children and pregnant women should be advised to consume nonpiscivorous and/or small fish species. Hg levels should also be investigated in other areas of the Amapa coastal plain.

A pyrolysis chamber is described for the direct determination of mercury in sediments by atomic absorption spectrometry. The finely ground and dried sample is weighed (2.0-60.0 mg), transferred to a quartz cup, inserted in a pyrolysis chamber and heated at 1100 °C for 30 s by means of three focused infrared lamps in the presence of an air stream as the carrier gas. Interfering substances are destroyed by a precolumn containing alumina, silica and copper(n) oxide, and the released mercury is amalgamated on to a gold-coated collector. Mercury vapour is later measured by AAS after thermal desorption. Calibration is easily performed by flow injection, in which known volumes of mercury-saturated air are introduced into the same air carrier stream. The absolute detection limit was 0.26 ng Hg and the relative standard deviation of measurements (n = 12) from a typical 4.0 mg sample was about 7%. By applying a t-test, there was no significant difference at the 5% probability level between the results obtained with the proposed method and those certified or recommended for NIST materials. One analysis takes only 2 min, including sample weighing.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Lyophilized fish tissues and bottom sediments were decomposed in a
microwave oven, The behavior of the inner pressure was observed for two
different digestion solutions in absence of samples, by varying the
number of digestion vessels, For fish analysis, effects of fat content,
sample amount and volume of HNO3 were investigated, Decomposition of the
sediment samples was studied by varying sample amount, carbon content
and the volume of the digestion solution, In all situations, pressure
profile curves were built up, Samples were analyzed by flow injection
cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry, Two programs were checked by
using standard reference material (IAEA-350) for fish muscular tissue
and laboratory intercomparison (Laboratory of Biofisica, UFRJ/RJ) for
sediment samples, The fish fat content had no influence on the yield of
the solubilization process, but the percentage of carbon in the
sediments influenced the behavior of the sample digestion, In both
cases, recoveries higher than 90% were calculated, The account the
routine analysis, according to an automated mercury determination.

The chemical composition of the phycocolloids from two Senegalese red
algae Anatheca montagnei and Meristotheca senegalensis (Soleriaceae) has
been compared with the hybrid iota-kappa carrageenan from commercial
Euchema spinosum. A partially desulfated major iota carrageenan was
identified. The milk strengths of gels from the Senegalese species were
similar to those from Euchema spinosum suggesting potential economical
applications.
