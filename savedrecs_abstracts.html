<blockquote><font size="-1">
Forests represent an important role in the control of atmospheric
   emissions through carbon capture. However, in forest fires, the carbon
   stored during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. The carbon
   quantification, in forest burning, is important for the development of
   measures for its control. The aim of this study was to quantify CO2 and
   CO emissions of forest fires in Western Amazonia. In this paper, results
   are described of forest fire experiments conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul
   and Rio Branco, state of Acre, and Candeias do Jamari, state of
   Rondonia, Brazil. These cities are located in the Western portion of the
   Brazilian Amazon region. The biomass content per hectare, in the virgin
   forest, was measured by indirect methods using formulas with parameters
   of forest inventories in the central hectare of the test site. The
   combustion completeness was estimated by randomly selecting 10% of the
   total logs and twelve 2 x 2 m(2) areas along three transects and
   examining their consumption rates by the fire. The logs were used to
   determine the combustion completeness of the larger materials
   (characteristic diameters larger than 10 cm) and the 2 x 2 m(2) areas to
   determine the combustion completeness of small-size materials (those
   with characteristic diameters lower than 10 cm) and the. The overall
   biomass consumption by fire was estimated to be 40.0%, 41.2% and
   26.2%, in Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Branco and Candeias do Jamari,
   respectively. Considering that the combustion gases of carbon in open
   fires contain approximately 90.0% of CO2 and 10.0% of CO in volumetric
   basis, the average emission rates of these gases by the burning process,
   in the three sites, were estimated as 191 +/- 46.7 t ha(-1) and 13.5 +/-
   3.3 t ha(-1), respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug that is
   regularly employed in veterinary medicine. In this work, the sorption
   and desorption of IVM in two Brazilian soils (N1-sand and S2-clay) as
   well as its leaching capacity, dissipation under aerobic conditions, and
   degradation in aqueous solution by photocatalysis with TiO2 in
   suspension were evaluated. The kinetic sorption curves of IVM were
   adjusted to a pseudo-second-order model. The sorption and desorption
   data were well fitted with the Freundlich isotherms in the log form (r &gt;
   0.96). The Freundlich sorption coefficient (K (F) (ads) ) and the
   Freundlich desorption coefficient (K (F) (des) ) were 77.7 and 120 mu
   g(1-1/n) (cm(3))(1/n) g(-1) and 74.5 and 138 mu g(1-1/n) (cm(3))(1/n)

   IVM was observed for the sandy soil N1 than for the clay soil S2. Under
   aerobic conditions, the dissipation (DT50) at 19.3 A degrees C was 15.5
   days (soil N1) and 11.5 days (soil S2). Photocatalysis with UVC and TiO2
   in suspension resulted in the degradation of 98 % of IVM (500 mu g L-1)
   in water in 600 s. The toxicity (Daphnia similis) of the solutions
   submitted to the photocatalytic process was completely eliminated after
   10 min.

Mercury is toxic for human health and one of the main routes of exposure
   is through consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish. The objective
   of this work was to assess the possible mercury contamination of
   bivalves (Anomalocardia brasiliana, Lucina pectinata, Callinectes
   sapidus), crustacean (C sapidus) and fish (Bagre marinus and Diapterus
   rhombeus) collected on Salinas da Margarida, BA (Brazil), a region which
   carciniculture, fishing and shellfish extraction are the most important
   economic activities. The effect of cooking on Hg concentration in the
   samples was also studied. The results showed that Hg concentration was
   generally higher in the cooked samples than in raw samples. This
   increase can be related to the effect of Hg pre-concentration, formation
   of complexes involving mercury species and sulfhydryl groups present in
   tissues and/or loss of water and fat. The highest concentrations were
   found in B. rnarinus samples ranging 837.0-1585.3 mu g kg(-1), which
   exceeded those recommended by Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency
   (ANVISA). In addition, Hg values found in the other samples also suggest
   the monitoring of the Hg concentrations in seafood consumed from the

   Calculations were based on a large survey of published and unpublished

   Amazonian region. Litterfall based on 65 sites located in the Amazon
   rainforest averaged 8.15 +/- 2.25 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). Average Hg

   +/- 14 mu g m(-2) yr(-1). This value was used to estimate that in the
   Amazonian rainforest, litterfall would be responsible for the annual
   removing of 268 +/- 77 Mg of Hg, approximately 8% of the total

Fluoroquinolones are potent antibacterial agents that are active against

   The degree of sorption of these antimicrobials to soils varies widely,
   as does the mobility of these drugs. In the present study, sorption of
   norfloxacin in four soils of the state of Sao Paulo was investigated
   with batch equilibrium experiments. A strong matrix effect on the
   chromatographic determination of norfloxacin was verified. Sorption
   kinetics were best fit by a pseudo second-order model (r &gt; 0.99), and
   sorption/desorption isotherms were well fit by the Freundlich model in

   particles, with K-F sorption values ranging from 643 to 2410 mu

Forest ecosystems are a sink of atmospheric mercury, trapping the metal
   in the canopy, and storing it in the forest floor after litter fall.
   Fire liberates a portion of this mercury; however, little is known about
   the long-term release of mercury post deforestation. We conducted two
   large-scale experiments to study this phenomenon. In upstate New York,
   gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored continually using a
   Teflon dynamic surface flux chamber for two-weeks before and after
   cutting of the canopy on the edge of a deciduous forest. In Brazil,
   gaseous mercury emissions from soil were monitored in an intact
   Ombrophilous Open forest and an adjacent field site both before and
   after the field site was cleared by burning. In the intact forest,
   gaseous mercury emissions from soil averaged -0.73 +/- 1.84 ng m(-2)
   h(-1) (24-h monitoring) at the New York site, and 0.33 +/- 0.09 ng m(-2)
   h(-1) (daytime-only) at the Brazil site. After deforestation, gaseous
   mercury emissions from soil averaged 9.13 +/- 2.08 ng m(-2) h(-1) in New
   York and 21.2 +/- 0.35 ng m(-2) h(-1) at the Brazil site prior to
   burning. Gaseous mercury emissions averaged 74.9 +/- 0.73 ng m(-2) h(-1)
   after burning of the cut forest in Brazil. Extrapolating our data,
   measured over several weeks to months, to a full year period, deforested
   soil is estimated to release an additional 2.30 g ha(-1) yr(-1) of
   gaseous mercury to the atmosphere in the Brazilian experiment and 0.41 g
   ha(-1) yr(-1) in the New York experiment. In Brazil, this represents an
   additional 50% of the mercury load released during the fire itself. (C)

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Several recent studies have indicated that forest fires are likely to
   re-emit important quantities of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg)
   to the atmosphere. Although the Amazon forest accounts for approximately
   25% of the world's total rainforest, few data are available about these
   emissions. The emissions of mercury from prescribed fires of two 4-ha
   plots of Amazon forest were investigated. Hg concentration and Hg burden
   were determined for vegetation, litter and soil before and after the
   fires. The data show that only Hg present in the aboveground vegetation
   and in the O-horizon was volatilised; no significant soil emission was
   observed. Before the fire, the Hg stored in the vegetation (logs,
   branches, leaves and litter) ranged from 3.7 to 4.0 g ha(-1) while 1.8 g
   ha(-1) was found in the O-horizon. The mass balance calculations of the
   present work indicate an average Hg emission of 3.5 g ha(-1) due to
   forest fires, with 1.6 ha(-1) originating from O-horizon and 1.9 from
   above ground vegetation. On the base of the average annual deforestation
   rate of the Brazilian Amazon between 2000 and 2008, an annual Hg
   emission of 6.7 Mg yr(-1) was estimated. Citation: Michelazzo, P. A. M.,

 Major Aspects of the Mercury Cycle in the Negro River Basin,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Despite the low level of industrial activity and human density, Hg
   concentration in the Negro River basin is relatively high. Soil enriched
   with naturally high Hg concentrations and atmospheric deposition are the
   main sources of the metal in this watershed. Differences between
   invasive and evasive fluxes at the water/air and soil/air interfaces
   indicate Hg accumulation in the basin at a rate of 39.9 t y(-1). The
   type of soil, which is the main source of mercury for the water bodies,
   the hydrological cycle with floods and dry periods, act markedly on the
   water redox chemistry. A complex interaction between many seasonable
   variables such as solar intensity, water pH, age of the naturally
   occurring organic matter and the hydrological cycle alter the redox
   characteristics of these black water bodies, thus markedly affecting the
   consumption of Hg-0 and the degradation of methylmercury present in the
   water. Although methylation is favored in black waters, photodegradation
   counterpoints this formation, thus regulating the methylmercury burden
   in the water column.

Arsenic oxidation (As(III) to As(V)) and As(V) removal from water were
   assessed by using TiO2 immobilized in PET (polyethylene terephthalate)
   bottles in the presence of natural sunlight and iron salts. The effect
   of many parameters was sequentially studied: TiO2 concentration of the
   coating solution, Fe(III) concentration, pH, solar irradiation time;
   dissolved organic carbon concentration. The final conditions (TiO2
   concentration of the coating solution: 10%; Fe(II): 7.0 mg l(-1); solar
   exposure time: 120 min) were applied to natural water samples spiked
   with 500 mu g l(-1) As(III) in order to verify the influence of natural
   water matrix. After treatment, As(III) and total As concentrations were
   lower than the limit of quantitation (2 mu g l(-1)) of the voltammetric
   method used, showing a removal over 99%, and giving evidence that
   As(III) was effectively oxidized to As(V). The results obtained
   demonstrated that TiO2 can be easily immobilized on a PET surface in
   order to perform As(III) oxidation in water and that this TiO2
   immobilization, combined with coprecipitation of arsenic on Fe(III)
   hydroxides(oxides) could be an efficient way for inorganic arsenic
   removal from groundwaters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of Total Gaseous Mercury (TGM) and Total Particulate
   Mercury (TPM) were monitored during the 2002-2003 rainy and dry seasons
   at two sampling points (industrial and residential areas) of the
   Campinas Metropolitan Region. No significant difference was observed
   between the concentrations found at the two sampling areas and the mean
   values were 7.0 +/- 5.8 ng M-3 (TGM) and 0.4 +/- 0.3 ng m(-3) (TPM). The
   analysis of the diel variability showed higher TGM concentrations during
   the day, which could be related to more intense anthropogenic activity
   during the day. Atmospheric dispersion processes could also explain some
   seasonal variation observed in TGM concentrations. For TPM
   concentrations a decreasing trend was observed during the rainy season,
   which could be explained by the removal of particles by wet deposition.
   The concentrations of TGM and TPM found in this study were of the same
   order of magnitude of those recorded in some highly industrialized
   regions of the northern hemisphere. These data show that emissions from
   the most industrialized Brazilian regions, and probably from similar
   regions in other countries of the southern hemisphere, should also be

A sampling and analysis program has been completed between 1995 and 1998
   in order to determine mercury concentrations in water, sediments, soils
   and fish in the Piracicaba river basin, one of the most populated and
   industrialized regions in Brazil. In sediment, the average Hg
   concentrations varied between 33 +/- 17 ng g(-1) and 106 +/- 78 ng
   g(-1), in samples collected during the rainy and dry season,
   respectively. The same averages were also found for soil samples (35 +/-
   14 and 109 +/- 61 ng g(-1)). In water, the total Hg concentration varied
   between &lt; 1.1 and 24.0 ng L-1. In piscivore fish, up to 943 mu g Hg
   kg(-1)supercript stop was found. Our results show that all compartments
   undergo Hg contamination, in view of the levels found in pristine
   environments. Water contamination seems to be due mainly to diffuse
   processes of soil erosion and suspension of river bed sediment during
   the rainy season. Also untreated wastewaters generated by industrial
   activities and from domestic sewage appear to be potential non-point
   sources in the most industrialized and populated part of the basin. On

   contamination, especially in the basin headwaters.

This work focuses on the behaviour of mercury in lateritic soil profiles
   found in the Serra do Navio and Tartarugalzinho areas of the State of
   Amapa in Northern Brazil. The Hg contents are high in the upper horizons
   of the soil profiles (100-300 mug kg(-1)), and decrease to less than 100
   mug kg(-1) at depths of 200 or 300 cm. The higher levels of Hg are
   associated with higher Fe concentrations, particularly in the
   ferruginous accumulations as mottles and nodules. For each horizon of
   the soil profile, balance calculations were used to distinguish the
   amount of mercury naturally accumulated from rocks through lateritic
   pedogenesis (lithogenic mercury) from the anthropogenic mercury
   introduced in the profile through atmospheric contamination. The results
   show that the anthropogenic contribution is significant in the upper
   horizons (up to 95%% of the total Hg), and decreases downward in the
   soil profile. Mercury burdens were calculated for soil profiles in both
   upslope (272 880 and 217 440 mug m(-2) for the first 70 cm) and
   downslope positions (118 800 and 182 160 % mug m(-2) for the first 70
   cm). The loss of Hg in downslope profiles seems to be related to the
   natural evolution of iron duricrust into latossols, which has been
   brought about by climatic changes toward increasing humidity in the
   Amazon since the Tertiary.

   is covered by a natural rainforest and lower part was altered due to
   deforestation and activities related to manganese mining. The catchment
   area is 200 km from the nearest gold mining (garimpo). Minimum and

   attributed to dry deposition. The stream output of 2.9 mu g m(-2)

   dried sample is weighed (2.0-60.0 mg), transferred to a quartz cup,
   inserted in a pyrolysis chamber and heated at 1100 degrees C for 30 s by
   means of three focused, infrared lamps in the presence of an air stream
   as-the carrier gas, Interfering substances are destroyed by a precolumn
   containing alumina, silica and copper(li) oxide, and the released
   mercury is amalgamated on to a gold-coated collector, Mercury vapour is
   later measured by AAS after thermal desorption, Calibration is easily
   performed by flow injection, in which known volumes of mercury-saturated
   air are introduced into the same air carrier stream, The absolute
   detection limit was 0.26 ng Hg and the relative standard deviation of
   measurements (n=12) from a typical 4.0 mg sample was about 7%, By
   applying a t-test, there was no significant difference at the 5%
   probability level between the results obtained with the proposed method
   and those certified or recommended for NIST materials, One analysis
   takes only 2 min, including sample weighing.

 On-line microwave-assisted sample decomposition for lead
  determination in fish slurry samples by electrothermal atomic absorption
  spectrometry.
 <em>JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY</em>, 8(1):39-45,
  JAN-FEB 1997.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
An on-line microwave-assisted decomposition procedure for the
   determination of lead in fish is proposed. 300 mu L slurry and 400 mu L
   of a 6 mol L(-1) HNO3 solution were simultaneously injected, and the
   mixture was positioned inside a microwave oven. The decomposed sample
   inside the flushing solution was collected in the autosampler cup of a
   graphite furnace. The proposed procedure covered the 2.5 to 25 mu g
   L(-1) Pb range and presented a detection limit of 0.72 mu g L(-1) Pb.
   Precision expressed as RSD, was 10.5% (n = 20) for repeatability and
   14.3% (n = 10) for reproducibility. Accuracy was assessed using
   standard reference material, and also by comparing the results to a
   nitric-perchloric decomposition procedure.

 MICROWAVE DIGESTION FOR MERCURY DETERMINATION IN FISH-TISSUES AND
  BOTTOM SEDIMENTS BY AUTOMATED COLD VAPOR ATOMIC-ABSORPTION SPECTROMETRY.
 <em>QUIMICA NOVA</em>, 18(5):425-430, SEP-OCT 1995.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Lyophilized fish tissues and bottom sediments were decomposed in a
   microwave oven, The behavior of the inner pressure was observed for two
   different digestion solutions in absence of samples, by varying the
   number of digestion vessels, For fish analysis, effects of fat content,
   sample amount and volume of HNO3 were investigated, Decomposition of the
   sediment samples was studied by varying sample amount, carbon content
   and the volume of the digestion solution, In all situations, pressure
   profile curves were built up, Samples were analyzed by flow injection
   cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry, Two programs were checked by
   using standard reference material (IAEA-350) for fish muscular tissue
   and laboratory intercomparison (Laboratory of Biofisica, UFRJ/RJ) for
   sediment samples, The fish fat content had no influence on the yield of
   the solubilization process, but the percentage of carbon in the
   sediments influenced the behavior of the sample digestion, In both
   cases, recoveries higher than 90% were calculated, The account the
   routine analysis, according to an automated mercury determination.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The chemical composition of the phycocolloids from two Senegalese red
   algae Anatheca montagnei and Meristotheca senegalensis (Soleriaceae) has
   been compared with the hybrid iota-kappa carrageenan from commercial
   Euchema spinosum. A partially desulfated major iota carrageenan was
   identified. The milk strengths of gels from the Senegalese species were
   similar to those from Euchema spinosum suggesting potential economical
   applications.
